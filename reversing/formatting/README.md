## Writeup

The description doesn't really lead us anywhere. Let's download the attached file and see what kind it is.

```bash
file formatting
```

```
formatting: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=bd9f51c1f1535b269a0707054009063f984f6738, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, not stripped
```

It appears to be an executable file in **ELF**. Let's try to run it.

```bash
./formatting
```

```
haha its not that easy}
```

Clearly that didn't work. Looks like we have to dig up the file a little. Since it's an **ELF** file, let's use the `readelf` command to dump the `.rodata` section.

```bash
readelf -x .rodata formatting
```

```

  0x00002060 00
```

It appears to be hinting that `DUCTF{ha ha its not that easy}` is the flag, but it doesn't really fit the typical flag format, and if we try it, we'll get a failed submission. This is not a deadend though, because there are two other strings; `%s%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x}`, which looks like a **format string**, and `d1d_You_Just_ltrace_`, which appears to be hinting at the use of the `ltrace` command. Let's give it a shot.

```bash
ltrace formatting
```

```
sprintf("d1d_You_Just_ltrace_296faa2990ac"..., "%s%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%0"..., "d1d_You_Just_ltrace_", 0x29, 0x6f, 0xaa, 0x29, 0x90, 0xac, 0xbc, 0x36) = 37
puts("haha its not that easy}"haha its not that easy}
)                                         = 24
```

We can see that `sprintf` is being used to generate a string with `d1d_You_Just_ltrace_` and a sequence of eight 2-character sequences. If we manually format the end result, we obtain the flag `DUCTF{d1d_You_Just_ltrace_296faa2990acbc36}`.
