My friend has been sending me lots of WAV files, I think he is trying to communicate with me, what is the message he sent?

**Attached file:** [message_1.wav](./message_1.wav)

## Writeup

The title of the challenge leads us to use a **Spectrometer** to analyze the sound file. We're going to open **Audacity** and use the spectrometer on the file.
